The run_analysis.R script will take the UCI HAR Dataset and produce the desired results in a file called getdata-002_tidy_dataset.txt. The user must have the R packages plyer and reshape installed. The UCI HAR Dataset must be unzipped into the users working directory. Once the user has ensured these conditions the file can be run in the working directory.
